Experience or Lessons Learned: Share any insights or lessons you gained from the camp.

I learned many different things during the week at the SJSU WITH Cyber Camp! 
Some of these things included the different jobs, fields, and careers that cybersecurity offers.
These included Cyber Defense Analysts, Forensics, etc...
Additionally, I was told of the programs that colleges, universities, and SJSU have towards cybersecurity.
As a result, I could actually narrow down what I want to major in at college after high school, and that being computer engineering or electrical engineering computer science (EECS).
I thoroughly enjoyed all the activities the camp provided, as well as the support from all the professors and staff members. 
Thank you so much for making my week at camp a memorable one!


Sample Code: Provide any sample code you wrote, and consider enhancing it.

Some code I wrote include deleting hacker files as shown below from the Terminal:
withcyber@withcyber:~ $ rmdir /home/withcyber/Desktop/GOTFILE?GOTFILE?1.1
This command line deletes the file from its directory in the file folder.
I had to manually code for each file because I did not have the permission to delete all files at once, and it got super annoying!


Further Exercises: Share any additional exercises, code, or experiments you conducted.

As stated above, I experimented with the code in order to figure out a way to get rid of all the annoying file folders on my desktop, and succeeded.
I was able to trash the GOTFILE? files and the NEEDAFILE? files.


Projects: Propose or develop any projects based on what you have learned.

I think I may start working on a new project on my RaspberryPi for CyberPatriot, a cybersecurity club at my school that I am a part of.
I want to use my Pi to start scripting to make it easier for me to get through cybersecurity tasks faster.
